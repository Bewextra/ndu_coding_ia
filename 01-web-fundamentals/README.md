# ðŸ“š Project 1: Web Fundamentals

**Focus:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript Basics

Welcome to your first hands-on project! In this project, you'll build a complete interactive web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of your AI assistant.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will understand:
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS styling (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Form validation
- Local storage

## Project Goal

Build an **Interactive Task Manager** web application with the following features:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter tasks (all, active, completed)
- Save tasks to local storage
- Responsive design
- Beautiful UI

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder in your code editor
2. You'll find three empty files:
   - `index.html` - Your HTML structure
   - `css/styles.css` - Your styles
   - `js/script.js` - Your JavaScript logic

3. Follow the prompts below, copying them into your AI assistant (Cursor AI) one at a time

## AI Prompts - Copy & Paste These Step-by-Step

### Prompt 1: Create the Basic Page Layout
```
Help me create a to-do list app! I need to build the basic structure in index.html.

I want my page to have:
- A header at the top with the title "My Task Manager"
- A form where I can type in new tasks (with a text field for the task name, a bigger text box for details, and an "Add Task" button)
- Three buttons to filter tasks: "All", "Active", and "Completed"
- An area where all my tasks will show up
- A footer at the bottom with my name

Can you help me set this up using proper HTML? Make sure to use good class names so we can style it later!
```

### Prompt 2: Make It Look Beautiful
```
Now I need to style my to-do list app in css/styles.css to make it look modern and professional!

Here's what I'm imagining:
- Pick a nice color scheme for me (maybe something calming and modern?)
- Center everything on the page with some nice spacing
- Give the header a cool gradient background
- Make the input fields and buttons look modern with:
  - Rounded corners
  - Subtle shadows
  - Nice effects when I hover over buttons
  - A glowing effect when I click in the input fields
- Use lots of white space so it doesn't feel cramped
- Pick a clean, easy-to-read font

I want it to look like a professional app! Feel free to be creative with the design.
```

### Prompt 3: Make It Work on Phones and Tablets
```
I want my to-do list app to look great on any device - phones, tablets, and computers!

Can you update the CSS in css/styles.css to:
- Make sure everything looks good when the browser window is small (like on a phone)
- Stack the form fields vertically on small screens so they're easier to use
- Make the text bigger on phones so it's easy to read
- Adjust the spacing so nothing feels cramped on small screens
- Keep everything looking nice on tablets and big screens too

I want to be able to use this app whether I'm on my phone or my laptop!
```

### Prompt 4: Make the "Add Task" Button Actually Work
```
Now I need to make my app actually do something! In js/script.js, help me make it so when I type a task and click "Add Task", it shows up on the page.

Here's what should happen:
- When I click "Add Task", grab what I typed in the form
- Create a new task item with:
  - The task title and description I entered
  - A checkbox so I can mark it complete later
  - A delete button to remove it
  - Maybe a timestamp so I know when I added it
- Show this new task in the task list area
- Clear out the form so I can add another task

Also, keep all my tasks stored in a list so I can work with them later. Each task should appear on the page with its title, description, a checkbox, and a delete button.
```

### Prompt 5: Make Tasks Interactive (Complete, Delete, Edit)
```
Now I want to be able to interact with my tasks in js/script.js! Help me add these features:

**Completing tasks:**
- When I click the checkbox next to a task, it should get crossed out (strikethrough style)
- The task should stay on the list but look "done"

**Deleting tasks:**
- When I click the delete button, that task should disappear from my list completely

**Editing tasks:**
- Add an "Edit" button to each task
- When I click it, the task's info should fill back into the form at the top
- When I click "Add Task" again, it should update that task instead of creating a new one

Make sure the list updates on the page after I do any of these actions!
```

### Prompt 6: Add Filtering Buttons
```
I want to be able to filter my tasks in js/script.js!

When I click the filter buttons at the top:
- "All" should show all my tasks (both done and not done)
- "Active" should only show tasks I haven't completed yet
- "Completed" should only show tasks I've checked off

Also:
- Highlight whichever filter button I'm currently using so I know what I'm looking at
- Show me a count of how many active (not completed) tasks I have left

The filter should just show/hide tasks without actually deleting them!
```

### Prompt 7: Save My Tasks So They Don't Disappear
```
Right now, if I refresh the page, all my tasks disappear! I need help in js/script.js to save them.

Can you make it so:
- Whenever I add, complete, edit, or delete a task, it gets automatically saved
- When I open the app again (even after closing the browser), all my tasks are still there
- The tasks are saved in my browser's storage

Basically, I want my task list to remember everything, just like a real app would!
```

### Prompt 8: Add the Final Polish
```
Let's make this app feel really professional and smooth!

**Animations:**
- Add smooth transitions when I hover over buttons
- Make tasks fade in nicely when I add them
- Make tasks slide out smoothly when I delete them
- Add a subtle animation when I check off a task

**Prevent mistakes:**
- Don't let me add a task if the title is empty - show me a friendly error message
- Give me a visual cue (like a red border) if I try to submit an empty form

**Nice extras:**
- Add a "Clear Completed" button that removes all the checked-off tasks at once
- Show a friendly message like "No tasks yet! Add one above" when my list is empty
- Display how many tasks I have left to complete

I want the app to feel smooth and professional, like apps I use every day!
```

## Testing Your Application

After completing all prompts, test these scenarios:

1. âœ… Add multiple tasks
2. âœ… Mark tasks as complete
3. âœ… Filter between All, Active, and Completed
4. âœ… Edit existing tasks
5. âœ… Delete tasks
6. âœ… Refresh the page - tasks should persist
7. âœ… Resize the browser - app should be responsive
8. âœ… Try to add an empty task - should show error

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:
- Double-click the file, or
- Right-click and select "Open with" â†’ Your browser, or
- Use the Live Server extension in VS Code

## Tips for Success

1. **Go step-by-step:** Complete one prompt before moving to the next
2. **Understand the code:** Read what the AI generates and ask questions
3. **Experiment:** Try modifying the code to add your own features
4. **Debug:** Use browser DevTools (F12) to inspect and debug
5. **Customize:** Change colors, add features, make it your own!

## Bonus Challenges

Once you complete the main project, try asking your AI assistant to add these cool features:

1. **Priority levels:** Color-code tasks as High (red), Medium (orange), or Low (green) priority
2. **Due dates:** Add a date picker so you can set when tasks are due, and sort them by date
3. **Categories:** Tag tasks like "Work", "Personal", "School" and filter by category
4. **Search bar:** Find specific tasks by typing keywords
5. **Statistics dashboard:** Show cool stats like "You've completed 75% of your tasks this week!"
6. **Dark mode:** Add a toggle button to switch between light and dark themes
7. **Drag and drop:** Let yourself reorder tasks by dragging them around
8. **Task notes:** Add a section where you can write longer notes about each task

## Key Concepts You'll Learn

- âœ… HTML5 semantic elements
- âœ… CSS Flexbox and Grid
- âœ… CSS animations and transitions
